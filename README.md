# User Management Dashboard

This is a Python project featuring the library Dash which allows you to create a web-based application. 

Dash libraries include dash, dash_core_components, dash_html_components, and dash_table. Other libraries used include pandas and datetime.

This project assumes that you have a dataset on hand with user information such as: Name, Email, Group, Primary Tool, and Last Update.

Some logic will be done to group the number of users, how many are in each group, and the number of tools available to all users. These will be highlighted at the dashboard above the table.

The dash table will consist of the dataset data but will be scrollable, order-able, and with pagination.
